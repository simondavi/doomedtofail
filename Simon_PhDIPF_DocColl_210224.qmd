## Intruduction

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Analysis

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this [@meyer1999]:

### Step 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
