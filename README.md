Although political and social interest as well as research on dropout have increased, little is known about dropout from teacher education. As the literature that does exist mostly focuses on examining individual variables to explain the phenomenon, this study aims to map subgroups of students by using a person-centered approach, gaining insights into the study process of teacher students at risk. In doing so we combine findings on dropout in general with the literature on teacher education, hypothesizing that teacher students at risk will not succeed in integrating into the social or academic domain of higher education institutions and as a result will not be able to make productive use of the learning opportunities available and therefore are more likely to drop out of teacher education compared to their peers.
